# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Project
Rock, Paper, Scissors game. Incorporates what I've learned so far with HTML, CSS, and JS.
This game is played by using console.log() to choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors as the player.
In the future I will be fleshing this out into a playable game in the webpage and not just the console.
